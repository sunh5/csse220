Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace Questions with Strings (yes or no)? 
	Yes

1.B Why or why not? (2-3 sentences)
	Because the Question class stores strings for the questions' content and answer.
	The quizId can also be stored in string instead of integer. 


2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1 to many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide type)
	HashMap<Integer, Question>
	HashMap<Integer, Quiz>

2.B. What is another type could you have used? (provide type) 
	ArrayList<Question> questions


2.C. Would that have made the code better or worse? Why? (2-3 sentences)
	Worse, because key of HashMap is unique, which means the ID is unique. It can avoid storing
	Question to one ID repeatedly.
