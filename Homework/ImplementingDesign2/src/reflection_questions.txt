Reflection Questions:

1. Compare your original draft and the final draft. What is the biggest difference between the two?
	The final draft has less dependence within classes, and adds some useful methods. The overall structure maintain the same. 


2. What did you have to change and why did you have to change it? If not, explain how you made your decisions in designing.
	I first thought the QuizTester class needs access to Quiz class to get the score calculated in Quiz, but
	I found it is not necessary and it makes class dependent too much with each other. 


3. Did you re-use your code from ImplementingDesign1? How much did you have to change it if so? (If not, then please explain why)
	Yes, I used a little bit of the previous code like getId, getAnswer, build hashmap. These are the only basic methods 
	that are not helpful to finish the goal of this design. Hence, all the key and useful methods are all new. 


4. Select one or more specific design principles and discuss how they relate to the your experience in designing and implementing the code for this assignment.
	Minimize dependenciesâ€‹ between objects when it does not disrupt usability or extendability (low coupling).
	It will avoid creating repeat Question. If you create some Quizs in main, and you recreate them in QuizTester, 
	it will have the same Quiz in two different locations. Some information will messing or stored into a wrong location that you can not use.
