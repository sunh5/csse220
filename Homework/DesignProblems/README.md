# CSSE 220: Design Problems

This exercise will let you practice object oriented design.  You will
do this exercise by yourself.

# Example Problems

[Here are a set of four design problems for you to practice on your
own](../../Docs/ExampleDesignProblems).  In addition, there is a
solution with commentary and good designs to compare with the designs
you produce on your own.

# The questions

Should be handed out in class but you can get them here:


+ [Part 1](DesignProblemsAssignment1.pdf)
+ [Part 2](DesignProblemsAssignment2.pdf)
+ [Part 3](DesignProblemsAssignment3.pdf)

# Turn-In Instructions 

You will turn in each packet at the beginning of the next class.

# Grading rubric 

+ 10 points for each problem (there are 6 total) 
+ Within an individual problem: 3 points for identifying what we
  consider the main problem in each flawed design.  You may list
  several flaws, but you won't get full credit unless you identify the
  main flaw.  This means you should look carefully and ensure your
  examination is exhaustive.  However, you will lose points for flaws
  that are incorrect (i.e. not really in the design).
+ Within an individual problem: 4 points for making a good design without flaws and
  expressing it in correct UML.
          
Total possible: 60 points.
